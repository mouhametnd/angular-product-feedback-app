## My process

### Built with

- Angular
- Rxjs
- NgRx
- Angular Router 
- Angular Reactive Forms 
- Tailwind CSS
- LocalStorage (to save documents and preferences to be accessed later)
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I've used `Angular` with `Rxjs` and `NgRx` to make the project, which helps me to get a better understanding of `Rxjs` library such as how to work with observables, and operators efficiently and how to implement and use state management in `Angular` using `NgRx` library.
